<p><strong>16 Week Workout Results</strong>, Its been an awesome 16 weeks and the results I managed to get from mainly home work outs. On one or two of your non-training days perform at least 30 minutes of moderate activity such as a recreational sport low-impact cardio or another mode of enjoyable exercise. For the first week there will be about a minute worth of rest in between sets until week four when I will go through all 8 exercises.</p>
