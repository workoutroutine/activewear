<p>Last Updated on Tue 18 May 2021 Social Responsibility. This is one of many reasons you can drop off your old clothes and discarded textiles at several of HM Groups brands and the reason many of them have launched upcycling initiatives.

Considerable resources are devoted to increasing sustainability at HM. So my advice is if its an article of clothing youre ok making the gamble on and you see it at HM or wherever go for it.
